# Introduction

Hi! I'm [Tianqi Zhao](https://tianqizhao.com). I'm one of the developers/office assistants of the Alumni Data Analytics Project. 

In order to help you familiarize with the tasks and the codes faster, I wrote this documentation to explain what the entire project is, how to start programming, how the codes are structured, and how to contribute to this documentation page.

If you have any questions after reading this documentation, feel free to reach out to me by email: louiszhao0517@gmail.com and cc to tz2529@columbia.edu

Alright, *let's get started!*
