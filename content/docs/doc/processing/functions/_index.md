# Functions offered by the program

## Three options

There are three things you can do with the program. The instruction will also pop up when you run `python3 code/main.py`.

1. [Process](process)
2. [Clean](clean)
3. [Exit](exit)

```
There are three options you can select:
	- (p)rocess raw.csv data: use default raw.csv to run data cleaning job
	- (c)lean cache and trash: clean all the useless data generated before
	- (e)xit: you can also exit
```

- If you have a handful of new grads' information to process, or if you just want to get the cleaned version of old data, you can proceed with `process` by just typing `p` when you are asked to select.
- When the cache and trash are getting overwhelming, you can proceed with `clean` by typing `c`.
- If you mistakenly run the program, you can just proceed with `exit` by typing `e`.
