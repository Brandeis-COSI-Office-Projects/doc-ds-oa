# Clean cache and trash

> Please be aware that "Clean" here does not refer to data cleaning, but refer to cleaning cache and trash generated during the data processing and cleaning job.

If you run the `clean` function, your console might look like this:

    >> Entering clean cache mode...

    We have removed unnecessary folders.

    [ -- See you next time! -- ]
    You can find console log file in log/Jul-21-2021-158.txt

And you should notice that your cache, log, result, and pending folder have been removed (if you have one).
