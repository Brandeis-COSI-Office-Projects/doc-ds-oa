# How to contribute to this documentation

## Hugo

This documentation is built on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). Hugo is a really fast static site generator built by Go. You will need prior Hugo and Markdown knowledge to proceed.

### Hugo Documentation

The [Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) is pretty useful for learning hugo. You don't need to know all the details. Just basic hugo commands, file directory, and how to write new pages.

I also recommend watching [Mike Danne's Youtube video](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3).

This project uses [Hugo Book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) theme to render the documentation.

After learning a bit of Hugo, you can start to contribute to this documentation. Simply `git clone` the repository to your local computer and start writing/modifying. **Do not touch the `.github` directory!**

## Markdown

All the files are written in Markdown. I suggest taking look at [the Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) if you don't have prior Markdown knowledge.
